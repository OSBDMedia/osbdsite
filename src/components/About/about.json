  "title": "About OSBD",
  "body": "<p>OSBD has its roots back in the mid 1990's when Pip Piper was a youth worker helping young people amongst other things to develop their creativity around making short films – one of those being Jon Miles who is now a Trustee.  Over time OSBD developed into a world class media charity and was formally incorporated and established as a charity in 2001. Over the next several years OSBD worked alongside young people enabling and training as well as creating numerous short films. Its innovative “Images for Worship” visual series and Talk Trigger video pieces had a big impact. OSBD was also commissioned by other charities /NGOs to make documentaries about their work, taking them as far afield as South America and the Ukraine. OSBD ran two “Breathe Film Festivals” exploring spirituality in film and brought together fresh innovators in contemporary culture from around the world for its ground breaking “Not Drowning Waving conferences.” Much respect should be paid to those who worked tirelessly alongside Pip, Rob Taylor, Tim Dendy, Debbie Piper, Rob Purbrick, Sarah Green and many others. Sarah continues to be the longest serving person alongside Pip.</p>\n<p>Over the past 18 months Pip has felt increasingly that “The Dog” has new work to do both building on previous projects but also into new areas. Its core aims however remain central:</p>\n<ul><li>Engaging young people / emerging culture through training and development in film-making.</li>\n<li>Creating media to explore, comment on and communicate spiritual and life / world issues.</li>\n<li>Connecting disparate groups and individuals interested in creativity and contemporary culture and faith to share, empower and evoke change.</li></ul>"
