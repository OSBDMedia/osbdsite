Sometimes it's called a \"filter\",\n\t// but that's not a great name for it, since that implies a thing where\n\t// some bits pass through, and others are simply ignored.  (That would\n\t// be a valid example of a transform, of course.)\n\t//\n\t// While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a\n\t// necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.  For example,\n\t// a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then\n\t// emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.\n\t//\n\t// Here's how this works:\n\t//\n\t// The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable\n\t// stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)\n\t// internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes\n\t// buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until\n\t// there's enough pending readable data buffered up.\n\t//\n\t// In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When\n\t// _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the\n\t// buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single\n\t// written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first\n\t// outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into\n\t// the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.\n\t//\n\t// This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,\n\t// since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,\n\t// a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering\n\t// here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is\n\t// interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many\n\t// bytes of output.  Writing the 4 bytes {ff,ff,ff,ff} would result in\n\t// 1kb of data being output.  In this case, you could write a very small\n\t// amount of input, and end up with a very large amount of output.  In\n\t// such a pathological inflating mechanism, there'd be no way to tell\n\t// the system to stop doing the transform.  A single 4MB write could\n\t// cause the system to run out of memory.\n\t//\n\t// However, even in such a pathological case, only a single written chunk\n\t// would be consumed, and then the rest would wait (un-transformed) until\n\t// the results of the previous transformed chunk were consumed.\n\t\n\t'use strict';\n\t\n\tmodule.exports = Transform;\n\t\n\tvar Duplex = __webpack_require__(19);\n\t\n\t/*<replacement>*/\n\tvar util = __webpack_require__(33);\n\tutil.inherits = __webpack_require__(23);\n\t/*</replacement>*/\n\t\n\tutil.inherits(Transform, Duplex);\n\t\n\tfunction TransformState(stream) {\n\t  this.afterTransform = function (er, data) {\n\t    return afterTransform(stream, er, data);\n\t  };\n\t\n\t  this.needTransform = false;\n\t  this.transforming = false;\n\t  this.writecb = null;\n\t  this.writechunk = null;\n\t  this.writeencoding = null;\n\t}\n\t\n\tfunction afterTransform(stream, er, data) {\n\t  var ts = stream._transformState;\n\t  ts.transforming = false;\n\t\n\t  var cb = ts.writecb;\n\t\n\t  if (!cb) return stream.emit('error', new Error('no writecb in Transform class'));\n\t\n\t  ts.writechunk = null;\n\t  ts.writecb = null;\n\t\n\t  if (data !== null && data !== undefined) stream.push(data);\n\t\n\t  cb(er);\n\t\n\t  var rs = stream._readableState;\n\t  rs.reading = false;\n\t  if (rs.needReadable || rs.length < rs.highWaterMark) {\n\t    stream._read(rs.highWaterMark);\n\t  }\n\t}\n\t\n\tfunction Transform(options) {\n\t  if (!(this instanceof Transform)) return new Transform(options);\n\t\n\t  Duplex.call(this, options);\n\t\n\t  this._transformState = new TransformState(this);\n\t\n\t  var stream = this;\n\t\n\t  // start out asking for a readable event once data is transformed.\n\t  this._readableState.needReadable = true;\n\t\n\t  // we have implemented the _read method, and done the other things\n\t  // that Readable wants before the first _read call, so unset the\n\t  // sync guard flag.\n\t  this._readableState.sync = false;\n\t\n\t  if (options) {\n\t    if (typeof options.transform === 'function') this._transform = options.transform;\n\t\n\t    if (typeof options.flush === 'function') this._flush = options.flush;\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  // When the writable side finishes, then flush out anything remaining.\n\t  this.once('prefinish', function () {\n\t    if (typeof this._flush === 'function') this._flush(function (er, data) {\n\t      done(stream, er, data);\n\t    });else done(stream);\n\t  });\n\t}\n\t\n\tTransform.prototype.push = function (chunk, encoding) {\n\t  this._transformState.needTransform = false;\n\t  return Duplex.prototype.push.call(this, chunk, encoding);\n\t};\n\t\n\t// This is the part where you do stuff!\n\t// override this function in implementation classes.\n\t// 'chunk' is an input chunk.\n\t//\n\t// Call `push(newChunk)` to pass along transformed output\n\t// to the readable side.

develop their creativity around making short films – one of those being Jon Miles who is now a Trustee.  Over time OSBD developed into a world class media charity and was formally incorporated and established as a charity in 2001. Over the next several years OSBD worked alongside young people enabling and training as well as creating numerous short films. Its innovative “Images for Worship” visual series and Talk Trigger video pieces had a big impact. OSBD was also commissioned by other charities /NGOs to make documentaries about their work, taking them as far afield as South America and the Ukraine. OSBD ran two “Breathe Film Festivals” exploring spirituality in film and brought together fresh innovators in contemporary culture from around the world for its ground breaking “Not Drowning Waving conferences.” Much respect should be paid to those who worked tirelessly alongside Pip, Rob Taylor, Tim Dendy, Debbie Piper, Rob Purbrick, Sarah Green and many others. Sarah continues to be the longest serving person alongside Pip.</p>\\n<p>Over the past 18 months Pip has felt increasingly that “The Dog” has new work to do both building on previous projects but also into new areas. Its core aims however remain central:</p>\\n<ul><li>Engaging young people / emerging culture through training and development in film-making.</li>\\n<li>Creating media to explore, comment on and communicate spiritual and life / world issues.</li>\\n<li>Connecting disparate groups and individuals interested in creativity and contemporary culture and faith to share, empower and evoke change.</li></ul>\"\n\t};\n\n/***/ },\n/* 179 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\n\t\t\"title\": \"Projects\",\n\t\t\"projects\": [\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\"title\": \"Youth Doc\",\n\t\t\t\t\"dates\": \"2017&mdash;2018\",\n\t\t\t\t\"description\": \"<p>2017 is the 50th anniversary of the pivotal film <em>Cathy Come Home</em> - a film that launched Crisis, Shelter and numerous housing associations. <em>Youth</em> is aiming high too, as it endeavors to bring home the story and reality of what it means to be young in 21st century Britain.

Sometimes it's called a \"filter\",\n// but that's not a great name for it, since that implies a thing where\n// some bits pass through, and others are simply ignored.  (That would\n// be a valid example of a transform, of course.)\n//\n// While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a\n// necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.  For example,\n// a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then\n// emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.\n//\n// Here's how this works:\n//\n// The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable\n// stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)\n// internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes\n// buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until\n// there's enough pending readable data buffered up.\n//\n// In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When\n// _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the\n// buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single\n// written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first\n// outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into\n// the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.\n//\n// This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,\n// since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,\n// a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering\n// here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is\n// interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many\n// bytes of output.  Writing the 4 bytes {ff,ff,ff,ff} would result in\n// 1kb of data being output.  In this case, you could write a very small\n// amount of input, and end up with a very large amount of output.  In\n// such a pathological inflating mechanism, there'd be no way to tell\n// the system to stop doing the transform.  A single 4MB write could\n// cause the system to run out of memory.\n//\n// However, even in such a pathological case, only a single written chunk\n// would be consumed, and then the rest would wait (un-transformed) until\n// the results of the previous transformed chunk were consumed.\n\n'use strict';\n\nmodule.exports = Transform;\n\nvar Duplex = require('./_stream_duplex');\n\n/*<replacement>*/\nvar util = require('core-util-is');\nutil.inherits = require('inherits');\n/*</replacement>*/\n\nutil.inherits(Transform, Duplex);\n\nfunction TransformState(stream) {\n  this.afterTransform = function (er, data) {\n    return afterTransform(stream, er, data);\n  };\n\n  this.needTransform = false;\n  this.transforming = false;\n  this.writecb = null;\n  this.writechunk = null;\n  this.writeencoding = null;\n}\n\nfunction afterTransform(stream, er, data) {\n  var ts = stream._transformState;\n  ts.transforming = false;\n\n  var cb = ts.writecb;\n\n  if (!cb) return stream.emit('error', new Error('no writecb in Transform class'));\n\n  ts.writechunk = null;\n  ts.writecb = null;\n\n  if (data !== null && data !== undefined) stream.push(data);\n\n  cb(er);\n\n  var rs = stream._readableState;\n  rs.reading = false;\n  if (rs.needReadable || rs.length < rs.highWaterMark) {\n    stream._read(rs.highWaterMark);\n  }\n}\n\nfunction Transform(options) {\n  if (!(this instanceof Transform)) return new Transform(options);\n\n  Duplex.call(this, options);\n\n  this._transformState = new TransformState(this);\n\n  var stream = this;\n\n  // start out asking for a readable event once data is transformed.\n  this._readableState.needReadable = true;\n\n  // we have implemented the _read method, and done the other things\n  // that Readable wants before the first _read call, so unset the\n  // sync guard flag.\n  this._readableState.sync = false;\n\n  if (options) {\n    if (typeof options.transform === 'function') this._transform = options.transform;\n\n    if (typeof options.flush === 'function') this._flush = options.flush;\n  }\n\n  // When the writable side finishes, then flush out anything remaining.\n  this.once('prefinish', function () {\n    if (typeof this._flush === 'function') this._flush(function (er, data) {\n      done(stream, er, data);\n    });else done(stream);\n  });\n}\n\nTransform.prototype.push = function (chunk, encoding) {\n  this._transformState.needTransform = false;\n  return Duplex.prototype.push.call(this, chunk, encoding);\n};\n\n// This is the part where you do stuff!\n// override this function in implementation classes.\n// 'chunk' is an input chunk.\n//\n// Call `push(newChunk)` to pass along transformed output\n// to the readable side.

around making short films – one of those being Jon Miles who is now a Trustee.  Over time OSBD developed into a world class media charity and was formally incorporated and established as a charity in 2001. Over the next several years OSBD worked alongside young people enabling and training as well as creating numerous short films. Its innovative “Images for Worship” visual series and Talk Trigger video pieces had a big impact. OSBD was also commissioned by other charities /NGOs to make documentaries about their work, taking them as far afield as South America and the Ukraine. OSBD ran two “Breathe Film Festivals” exploring spirituality in film and brought together fresh innovators in contemporary culture from around the world for its ground breaking “Not Drowning Waving conferences.” Much respect should be paid to those who worked tirelessly alongside Pip, Rob Taylor, Tim Dendy, Debbie Piper, Rob Purbrick, Sarah Green and many others. Sarah continues to be the longest serving person alongside Pip.</p>\\n<p>Over the past 18 months Pip has felt increasingly that “The Dog” has new work to do both building on previous projects but also into new areas. Its core aims however remain central:</p>\\n<ul><li>Engaging young people / emerging culture through training and development in film-making.</li>\\n<li>Creating media to explore, comment on and communicate spiritual and life / world issues.</li>\\n<li>Connecting disparate groups and individuals interested in creativity and contemporary culture and faith to share, empower and evoke change.</li></ul>\"\n};\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./src/components/About/about.json\n// module id = 178\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\n\t\"title\": \"Projects\",\n\t\"projects\": [\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"title\": \"Youth Doc\",\n\t\t\t\"dates\": \"2017&mdash;2018\",\n\t\t\t\"description\": \"<p>2017 is the 50th anniversary of the pivotal film <em>Cathy Come Home</em> - a film that launched Crisis, Shelter and numerous housing associations. <em>Youth</em> is aiming high too, as it endeavors to bring home the story and reality of what it means to be young in 21st century Britain.
